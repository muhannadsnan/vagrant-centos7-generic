# vagrant-package-msn
This repo is meant to bring up the box as quickly as possible, and avoid spending time on downloading fresh versions of packages/kernels, besides GuestAdditions, so that we can start using a fresh configured box right away.

# THIS VBOX HAS LINUX CENTOS 7
- KERNEL-DEVEL INSTALLED AND LATEST KERNEL UPDATE
- UPDATED YUM
- GUEST ADDITIONS ARE INSTALLED
- SHARED FOLDERS: /www & /provision

# NOTICE: 
Vagrant is meant to bring up a box via the vagrantfile, it is that simple, and not to export/import the box. I know that, so don't judge me ;)
